            <p class="content">Hpa-an is a small town that lies in pretty Kayin State in the southeast of Myanmar.
                The
                main
                reason why Hpa-an is famous
                is down to its idyllic scenery which is said to be some of the prettiest in the whole country.

                <div class="place-img">
                    <img src="/images/Kyauk Kalap.jpeg" alt="">
                </div>
                <h3>1.Climb Kyauk Kalap Pagoda</h3>
                <p>Kyauk Kalap is located in the middle of a pretty artificial lake and basically consists of a large
                    piece
                    of
                    dramatic
                    rock, atop which is a scenic pagoda.

                    Once you scale the rock you will be treated to amazing views of the surrounding scenery and you can
                    even
                    look across to
                    dominating Mount Zwegabin.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="place-to-go">
                <div class="place-img">
                    <img src="/images/local coffe.jpeg" alt="">
                </div>
                <h3>2.Have breakfast in a local coffee shop</h3>
                <p>If you want to start the day as the locals do, then head to a traditional teashop in Hpa-an such as
                    White
                    which is one
                    of the most famous teahouses in town.

                    Here you will find the signature breakfast in this part of Myanmar which consists of delicious
                    fluffy
                    flatbreads which
                    are served with a side of the local coffee.

                    This is a particularly good choice if you want to go out into the surrounding areas to go spelunking
                    as
                    you
                    can order
                    some of the flatbreads to take away and keep you going throughout the day.</p>

                    <img src="/images/Saddan Cave.jpeg" alt="">
                </div>
                <h3>3.Walk through Saddan Cave</h3>
                <p>Hpa-an is known for its cave, but probably the most spectacular is Saddan Cave.

                    The entrance is covered in statues of the Buddha and there are also a number of pagodas inside as
                    well
                    as
                    clay wall
                    carvings.

                    You can walk through the different chambers of the cave which takes around 15 minutes, and if you
                    are
                    not
                    afraid of the
                    dark then it is well worth it as you will pass amazing stalactites and walls that are made up of
                    natural
                    crystals.

                    Once you trek across the cave you can leave it through a hole on the other side which overlooks
                    lakes
                    and
                    mountains.</p>
